    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my introduction, where I am going to be talking about the BTT course. The BTT course has enhanced my understanding of creating an online business and added more of what technology really is to my knowledge/experience.Technology has always been a big thing, especially in the 21st century. At this point in time, itâ€™s critical for us to use technology such as computers, phones, laptops, etc. Computers can help us excel in our fields such as engineering, computer programming, crime stoppers, police, financial systems, etc. Computers can also help you find out who's hacking or taking your personal belongings from any online account that you may own.This course has taught me how to make an online business and how to manage your finances and computer parts. I never really had anything to do with computers or technology itself. Technology has always been a part of my life. But this class has not been short of experience in learning more about computers and websites. Overall, this was a great experience with the BTT course. My  skills are communication  and computer work and Creativity and innovation.and Problem solving.
